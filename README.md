# Titanic-Machine-Learning-From-Disaster-Using-Scikit-Learn
# 1. Introduction
This project highlights my approach to the introductory machine learning competition on Kaggle website- Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.The sinking of the RMS Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history. On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg, killing 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew.In this project I analyses which people were likely to survive. In particular, famous machine learning tools which is scikit-learn is used for this implementation.

# 2. Objective
To find how what sorts of people were more likely to survive?‚Äù
